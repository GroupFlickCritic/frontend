						We all are very different. We come from different backgrounds. We
						were born in different cities, at a different time. We have
						different hobbies, and interest. Although wee may be different what
						connects us all is flickcritic. The countless hours spent was all
						worth it to make our dreams a reality. Thank you from all of us for
						visiting our app. We hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed
						making flickcritic
